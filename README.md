 <summary> Project Title - ** Flashcard Generator**</summary>

 
**It has mainly three pages.**
 
•	**Create Flashcard Page**

**•	My Flashcard Page**

**•	Flashcard Detais Page**

> Create Flashcard Page –

It is the project’s first page, which will be used to create a particular flashcard. It contains two forms. The first form has three fields and is used to create a group. One input field to add the group’s name, a text area field to add the description about the group, and a button to add an image to the group. 
The second form mainly has three fields. One input field is to add the Term for the card, the second input field is to add the definition of the particular card, and the third is to select the image for the particular card. Selecting the image will generate the two icons aside from the image in the same row. The trash icon to delete a particular card or row and the Edit icon to modify the particular card. It will focus on the Term input field after clicking.  
We have a “**+Add more**” button to create more cards. With every click, it will add the same group of inputs.
Then you can create a flashcard using the “**Create**” button.

> My Flashcard Page –

The second page is to display all the created cards. By default, it will display the link to the home page if any cards are not created. After clicking the ‘**view cards**’, the User will be redirected to the flashcard details page.

> Flashcard Details Page -

On this page, the user can see all the cards by clicking on the menu on the left side of the display and the result will be shown in the middle of the display. On the right side, the user can use the buttons i.e. **Share, Download, Print** to share the cards, and download the cards. By clicking the share button a modal popup comes up in the middle of the screen where the user can copy the link and save it in the clipboard. Users can share the card on the same modal through social media apps like **Facebook, WhatsApp** etc.

**Additionally, we have added the toggle button to choose the mode from light to dark or dark to light.**
